          <p>If you know me at all, or even if you don't know me and just follow me on Instagram, you know that food and more
             specifically, pictures of food, are a top priority in my book. At some point, you stop caring about other people
             watching you take pictures of your food and go for the snap anyways. After that point, when almost all dignity
             is lost, you get to the point where you go into restaurants with a purpose and with your heavy duty camera. Is it
             unnecessary? Yes. Is it overkill? Yes. But will you thank yourself later? Absolutely yes. In the long run, it is
             actually a beneficial step because if you're ever out somewhere you have been to before, and a person you're eating with is wondering
             if a certain item on the menu is good, all you have to do is whip out your phone or camera, show them the picture,
             and ultimately save the day. So to answer the question no one asked, no, I do not regret this camera ritual. Anywho,
             this is the place where I'll display all the goodies and not-so-goodies that I've tasted along with a few tidbits about
             them. Just think of it as a food diary.</p>

          <p>This country never fails to amaze me with its odd flavor combinations that somehow work? I don't understand? When
             I tried this dish for the first time, I had no idea it was called Causa Rellena; all I knew was that I saw layers
             of tuna and potato stacked on top of each other with olives and other flourishings on top. The closest meal to
             mashed potatoes you will find, the potato layer nicely balances the crunch from the tuna salad adjacent to it. However,
             the casserole is a staple only served on rarer occassions unlike bread that is consumed approximately eight times a day.</p>

          <p>The poor little ones didn’t stand a chance. Rather than try to make this feel like you are not eating a guinea pig, cuy cooks strive to make the experience as realistic and gruesome as possible. That means that teeth, nails, eyes, internal organs, and any other body part are all fair game. Let’s just say no one owns a guinea pig as a pet in Peru. I will say though, having consumed one of these guys, the skin is the best part because the way it was cooked hardened the skin to a potato chip-like texture and consistency, and I cannot reject anything that resembles a potato chip.</p>

          <p>This dish comes with a bit of background that is quite interesting. Now you may have heard of burgers and fries, maybe even fish and fries, but what about steak and fries?
             In a nutshell, lomo soltado is a combo of steak and french fries, but it usually also includes rice and onions as sides. It is a hybrid of sorts, fusing
             Chinese with Peruvian cuisine in the early 1900s and serving as the Peruvian version of stir fry. If you like steak, and if you
             like french fries, there is really nothing that can go wrong here.</p>

          <p>Look to your left. Look to your right. Look in the fridge. Look in the trash. Just have the general
             ability to see. And Inca Kola will be there. The Peruvian equivalent of Coca Cola, Inka Kola is a drink that
             is difficult to describe. It’s yellow. It’s 10x sweeter than Coke. It’s bubbly. It has the faint aftertaste
             of bubblegum. I would say that it resembles
             a combination of cream soda and Sprite, but physically tasting it is the only way to do it a justice.</p>

             after a while. My American self was initially expecting some jelly or jam or something to ooze out of the middle
             (#raisedbypoptarts), but it is quite literally just a cookie with sprinkles on it. A.k.a. more bread a.k.a. loving
             it. Also, my amazingly awesome host mom packed me an entire box of these bad boys on the way back home, so they

          <p>Think of corn, ok, but corn that goes to the gym seven days a week and is on steroids. That mental image
            should match this actual image you see above. Instead of biting into maybe 10 kernels, your mouth can only handle
            one or two at a time to munch on those suckers. One kernel is about the size of a thumb, and that is intimidating
            just to think about. They were super good, but I will say that I am partial to the North
            American corn we have in this neck of the woods. The taste is much more bland and less sweet than the corn popular
            up North, but it can be integrated into almost any Peruvian dish you can think of due to its mild taste that
            gives it its versatility.</p>

          <p>My goodness my goodness. This tops cheesecake; this tops red velvet cake; this tops all of my formerly beloved
            cakes. Why, you ask? Well, as the name denotes, there are three types of milk that are poured into holes in the cake
            after it is baked, and the finished product is topped with a whipped goodness that is not too rich but not at all bland
            either. I sampled this Peruvian staple at probably five restaurants, and not one was a disappointment. Sometimes,
            you can find a sliver of caramel running through the middle of the cake that elevates the cake to a new realm. Although the pastry
            is not as light and airy as angel food cake, the whipped topping and the moisture coming from the milk in the cake
            give it a run for its money and prevents any dryness over time.</p>

             a bit spicy because of the added cinnamon and cloves. Oh, and she's made from that corn you see up there. Chicha
            morada is sold in gobs and gobs of stores, but it tastes best when made directly from the corn and not a powder with tons

          <p>What? You mean just a cake? Yes, I mean just the plain ole cake with no bells or whistles. What does this mean?
             This means that the actual cake is so good and so moist that icing is not even a necessity, and you can eat this
            treat on any occassion and at any time of day. Basically, it is the cake that you can have when you want cake

    whole website is supposed to be a place to share all these pictures I took and stuff I worte in Peru, yes, the Peru

    the motto better late than never than right now, and I promised myself and lots of other people that I would finish
    this, so here it is in all its tardy glory. It took so long because I straight up coded it with html and css, so apologies
    if you find any bugs or glitches in it. I'll try to get rid of those soon. Anywho, I hope you enjoy what I've got!</p>
